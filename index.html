            <small>SVU The Roleplaying Game is a game of cop propaganda and sexual fantasy, meant for an adult audience. Player discretion is advised. Please click the button labeled "play game" to play the game. By clicking "play game," you promise that you understand that the views expressed anywhere by anyone are not necessarily the views of the developers of SVU: The RPG, and that that's ok. You acknowledge that you do not work for NBC or represent them or their subsidiaries legally or otherwise. All dialogue in the soundtrack to this game was sampled from the TV show "Law and Order: Special Victims Unit," which aired during prime time for over 20 years, and continues to run, day and night, on cable stations around the world even today. All descriptions of heinous perp behavior similarly come directly from plotlines featured on the show.</small>
